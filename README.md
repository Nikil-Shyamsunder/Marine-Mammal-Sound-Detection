# Developing Highly-Accurate Neural Networks with Small Datasets for Marine Mammal Acoustic Classification

This is the code I wrote for my final project in the course BIOEE 1610: Introduction to Ecology at Cornell University. The project entailed me creating a small research project and writing up my results as a formal scientific paper. 

Conservation efforts for threatened marine mammals are uninformed due to data scarcity. Monitoring marine mammals to estimate abundances is a non-trivial task due to species rarity and large spatial distributions. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is gaining traction with the use of machine learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) effectively classify sounds through spectrogram analysis, but require large datasets, a rarity in marine mammal science. Transfer learning, a method to reduce the number of datapoints needed, was used to investigate the effect of dataset size on the accuracy of a CNN trained to distinguish between two marine mammal species by sound. The results show a weak, positive correlation between dataset size and model accuracy, with the regression line having r2=0.0945 and a slope of 0.0003. Only 20 datapoints were necessary to achieve 98% accuracy. Transfer learning enables accurate PAM systems with minimal initial data, allowing for larger studies that better inform conservation.
